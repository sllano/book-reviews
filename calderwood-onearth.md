# Eric Calderwood, *On Earth or in Poems*

as per the author's own words:
the study of the afterlives of al-Andalus has driven him to 
move away from being concerned about the ontology of al-Andalus, and towards a
phenomenology, that is, to account for the ways in which it has manifested in
different cultural and historial contexts.

not a tangible, palpable echo of the past thatn requires study as a fixed
object, but rather a method, and one that requires crossing linguistic,
geographic, and disciplinary boundaries, but that exposes how those boundaries
came into being
